# Basics of Web APIs

## 1. What is an API?
- API stands for Application Programming Interface.
- It is a set of rules that allows the software to communicate with each other.

## 2. Why do we use APIs?
- APIs allow different software systems to communicate and share data.
- They enable developers to access specific features or data from a service or platform without needing to understand its internal workings.

## 3. Types of APIs:
- Web APIs (HTTP/RESTful APIs): Most common in web development, allowing communication over HTTP.
- Library-based APIs: Code libraries that provide pre-written functionality.
- Operating System APIs: Enable communication with the underlying operating system.
- Database APIs: Allow interaction with databases.

## 4. Key Concepts:
- Endpoint: A specific URL where an API can be accessed.
- Request: An action to be performed (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Response: The data or result returned from the API after processing a request.
- HTTP Methods: Commonly used methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data).

## 5. REST (Representational State Transfer):
- A set of architectural principles for designing networked applications.
- Key principles include statelessness, client-server architecture, and a uniform interface.-
