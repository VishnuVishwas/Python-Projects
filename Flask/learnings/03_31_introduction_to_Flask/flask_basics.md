# Subchapter 3.1: Introduction to Flask

## Flask Basics

Flask is a micro web framework for Python that is lightweight and designed to be simple and easy to use. It follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and provides tools for building web applications with minimal code. Flask is known for its flexibility, making it a popular choice for projects of varying complexity.

Key features of Flask include:

- **Routing:** Defines how URLs map to functions in your code, allowing you to create different routes for various parts of your application.

- **Templates:** Enables the creation of dynamic HTML pages by integrating Python code within HTML, making it easier to generate content based on data.

- **HTTP Request Handling:** Flask allows you to handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for processing user requests.

- **Integration with Jinja2:** Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine for rendering templates, providing a powerful and flexible way to generate dynamic content.
