# Develop a Text-based Adventure Game.

## Adventure.py

### Game Concept:
  Embarks on an adventure in a mysterious forest, filled with magical creatures and hidden treasures. The ultimate quest is to discover the heart of the forest and return to the human world.

### While Loop:
  Maintains continuous player engagement by employing `while` loops, ensuring the game progresses until a win or game-over condition is met.
### User Choices:
  Utilises `input` and `int` conversions to capture and process user choices, steering the storyline and determining the game's outcome.
### Continue and Break:
  - Implements `continue` to prompt users for a new input in case of an invalid choice, sustaining the game's flow.
  - Utilises `break` to exit the loop and conclude the game when specific conditions, like finding the treasure, are satisfied.
